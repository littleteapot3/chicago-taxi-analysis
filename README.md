# Chicago Taxi Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Chicago taxi ride data to help Zuber, a new ride-sharing company, understand passenger demand and external factors that influence rides. The analysis focuses on competitor activity, ride volume by neighborhood, and whether weather impacts ride duration.

## Data Sources

- `./datasets/project_sql_result_01.csv` – Rides by company (Nov 15–16, 2017)
- `./datasets/project_sql_result_04.csv` – Average drop-offs per neighborhood (Nov 2017)
- `./datasets/project_sql_result_07.csv` – Ride duration from the Loop to O’Hare with weather conditions

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Plotly, SciPy)
- SQL (queries performed beforehand)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

- Flash Cab and Taxi Affiliation Services dominate ride volume.
- Central neighborhoods show the highest drop-off demand.
- Rainy weather does not significantly affect ride durations to O’Hare.
- Zuber can focus launch efforts in central Chicago and expect ride consistency regardless of weather.

## Project Goal

Deliver actionable insights using real-world data to support business decisions for a ride-sharing company's launch.
